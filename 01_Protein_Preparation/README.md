Project 1: Protein Preparation of HER2 (PDB ID: 5TDN)
Status

Completed

---
 Background

Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2), encoded by the **ERBB2** gene, is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is overexpressed in approximately 20–25% of breast cancer cases. HER2 overexpression is associated with aggressive tumor growth and poor clinical prognosis, making it an important therapeutic target in breast cancer research.

Protein preparation is a critical step in structure-based drug discovery because it ensures that the protein structure is suitable for molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations.

Objective

To prepare the HER2 protein structure (PDB ID: 5TDN) for molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation by removing unnecessary molecules, correcting the protein structure, and optimizing it for computational analysis.

 Methodology

1. Protein Retrieval

The crystal structure of HER2 (PDB ID: 5TDN) was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank.

2. Structure Inspection

The protein structure was examined to identify:
- Water molecules
- Co-crystallized ligand
- Heteroatoms
- Protein chains

3. Protein Cleaning

The following components were removed:
- Water molecules
- Co-crystallized ligand
- Unnecessary heteroatoms

4. Hydrogen Addition

Missing hydrogen atoms were added to improve the structural integrity and prepare the protein for molecular docking.

5. Protein Validation

The prepared protein was inspected to ensure:
- Proper chain selection
- Absence of unwanted molecules
- Correct structural integrity

6. File Preparation

The cleaned HER2 protein structure was saved in PDB format for subsequent molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations.
